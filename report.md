### Scenario

You are a visitor at a political convention withndelegates; each delegate is a member of exactlyone political party. It is impossible to tell which political party any delegate belongs to; in particular,you will be summarily ejected from the convention if you ask.

However, you can determine whetherany pair of delegates belong to the same party by introducing them to each other. Members ofthe same political party always greet each other with smiles and friendly handshakes; members of dffierent parties always greet each other with angry stares and insults.

Suppose more than half of the delegates belong to the same political party. Describe an efficient algorithm that finds out the size of the majority party. The efficiency of your algorithms is measured in terms of the numberof pair of delegates that you introduce to each other. We expect that you need about $O(n\log{n})$ handshakes.
